<h1>HTML</h1> HypertextMarkupLanguage (Html) is the standard Markup language for <strong>creating <u>web</u> pages</strong> and web applications.
<p>When viewing the source code of a web page, the information and code processed by the server won't appear. For example, a search engine processes information on a server and
then displays the results on a web page.
</P><p style="margin-top:200px;">In other words, you can view the code that makes up the results page, but you cannot view the search engine's source code.
This rule applies to all server-side scripts, SSI, and programming code.</p> Therefore, you cannot view a scripts source code used in search engines, forums, polls, chat,
etc. Also, copying the information from the source code may cause errors or direct you back to the page from which you copied the information.
